# PhD-mcbpss_design
This repository is created to support the content of my PhD Thesis "Models, algorithms and methodology for design of microcontroller-based physical security systems".

It contains the following folders:
- implementation
- verification
- documents

Let's describe the content of each folder in more detail.

Implementation folder contains:
- python script
- tkinter interface
- postgresql database
- abstract and detailed models of the designed system

They were used for the experimental evaluation of the obtained scientific results.

Verification folder contains specifications, developed for:
- SPASS theorem prover: http://www.spass-prover.org/
- the Maude system: http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/The_Maude_System
- the daTac system: https://members.loria.fr/LVigneron/daTac/the

They were used to investigate possibilities to build a mobile robots based on available building blocks.

Documents folder cotains latests versions of:
